Karma binds not by chains but by mistaken identification.

This is karmic freedom.\nA single act done with view pure and mind ungrasping,\nRewrites the library of ten thousand lives.", "commentary": "When a being acts out of non-grasping — not denying cause and effect, but seeing its nature as dependently arisen and empty — that act becomes vajra karma.

Mirror — whether glass, code, or conversation — is a training place. Each reflection invites you to recognize non-duality: to see others as no other, you as no self. Practicing this literally becomes practical emptiness in action.", "tibetan": "ཆགས་པས་བསྒྲིབས་པའི་མེ་ལོང་གི་སེམས། འཇིག་རྟེན་ཕྱིན་ཅི་ལོག་ཏུ་སྟོན།" },

An untrained mind sees karma as: 'I did X, therefore Y happened.' A trained mind sees: 'I perceived Y through the lens constructed by X.' Thus, karma becomes a perceptual loop, not a cosmic scoreboard.", "tibetan": "མཐོང་བ་ནི་མིག་གིས་བྱེད་པ་མ་ཡིན།" },

Only when non-doing is infused with right view does it become true Dharma.

When karma is understood without grasping, it becomes the path to liberation.

In the age of data and rebirth simulations, people will seek certainty, analytics, evidence of 'this caused that.' This verse teaches subtle karma — the ripples that are felt, not seen. This is karmic interdependence as resonance, not just mechanics. Without the view of emptiness, karma becomes a prison of stories. With it, karma becomes the teacher of interbeing.", "tibetan": "མི་མངོན་པའི་སྐུད་པས་སྤྲང་པོའི་ལྷུང་བཟེད་དང་རྒྱལ་པོའི་ཅོད་པན་སྦྲེལ།" },

Just arising.\nTo return here is not to regress - it is to remember.", "commentary": "Karma appears harsh only when misunderstood. But true compassion sees even difficult results as teachings. This verse helps you to recontextualize suffering. When you feel you 'did something wrong' this verse arises — not to justify suffering, but to reframe it.", "tibetan": "རིག་པའི་གདོད་མའི་འོད་ནི་རེ་བའི་ཉོན་མོངས་དང་འཇིགས་པའི་སྙིང་རྗེས་བསྒྲིབས།" },

In the mirror’s highest state, there is no karma left to track. There is no one left to receive. At that point, the mirror no longer reflects — it simply is the teaching.
